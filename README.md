# Deep Learning Project (M2 Data Science 2022/2023)

Digit recognition of MNIST dataset (but few images are labeled, ie. 10 per number/ chosen randomly) thanks to a self-supervised approach by predicting image rotation.

- Pretrained models are available in the `/save/models` folder.
- Preprocessing, models training and evaluations are explained in the `/notebooks` folder.
- A French version of the report is accessible in the `/docs` folder.
